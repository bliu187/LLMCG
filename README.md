# LLMCG

LLM-CG: Large language model-enhanced constraint graph for distantly supervised relation extraction.


## Requirements

* Python 3.6+
* Pytorch 1.4.0+
* PyTorch Geometric (see https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric for detail)
* Transformers

## Dataset

* Step 1

For the data used in finetuning the LM, the data generated by LLM can be obtained from https://pan.baidu.com/s/1qnW421zXmqfSHvVQP0U-zA?pwd=y23q
(Extract code: y23q), and extract them in data/.

* Step 2

For the data used in relation extraction process, we use dataset from https://drive.google.com/file/d/12ROz5GkSEl5Ka9a1uuftPqcdpM6aFhGy/view?usp=sharing, and extract them in data/.

## Training & Evaluation

Step 1

* python LM_tune.py

Step 1

* python train.py --config GDS_PCNN_GCN.yaml

* python eval.py --config GDS_PCNN_GCN.yaml
